[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/mams/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram in <<fig-LogicClassDiagram>>) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/mams/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `AppealListPanel`, `ModuleListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

// tag::logic[]
[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

.Structure of the Parser Component
image::ParserClassDiagram.png[]

.Structure of the Command Component
image::CommandClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/mams/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `MamsParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a module to a student).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

// end::logic[]

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("undo")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `undo` Command
image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/mams/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T11-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/mams/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Mams data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `mams.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

//tag::find[]
=== Find feature
==== Implementation

The find feature is facilitated by `FindCommand` class. The `FindCommand` stores a `List` of `Predicates`, which can be
StudentContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `ModuleContainsKeywordsPredicate`, or `AppealContainsKeywordsPredicate`. Each `Predicate` stores a `List` of String of keywords.

.Predicate Class Diagram
image::PredicateClassDiagram.png[]

Each `FindCommand` has a `execute()` method that takes in a `Model` object and a `FilterOnlyCommandHistory` object.
`FindCommand` only retrieves information from model and returns a message to be shown in the message bar but do not alter anything in the existing lists.

Below shows how the Find Command mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user inputs `find ...`.

Step 2. The `FindCommandParser` is called first to create `StudentContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `ModuleContainsKeywordsPredicate`, and `AppealContainsKeywordsPredicate` by checking the prefixes.

Step 3. A new `FindCommand` is created by passing in the `List` of `Predicates`.

Step 4. `FindCommand.execute()` is called. Each `Predicate` object is examined and calls `Predicate.test()`. `Model#updateStudentList()`, `Model#updateModuleList()`, or `Module#updateAppealList()` is called accordingly.

Step 5. A `CommandResult` object is returned, which contains message about the number of items found in the target list. The target list only shows the item(s) that contain(s) any of the keywords.

The following sequence diagram shows how the Find command works:

.Find Command Sequence Diagram - user input: "find m/cs1010"
image::FindSequenceDiagram.png[]


// end::find[]

//tag::clash[]
=== Clash feature
==== Implementation

The clash feature is facilitated by `ClashCommand` class.

There are two additional static classes in `ClashCommand` to facilitate the feature. The two classes are:

* `ClashCommandParameters`: Stores the details of the parsed parameters that a `ClashCommand` will operate on.

.ClashCommandParameters Class Diagram
image::ClashCommandParametersClassDiagram.png[]
* `ClashCase`: Stores the details of the clash cases between two modules that a `ClashCommand` will operate on.

.ClashCase Class Diagram
image::ClashCaseClassDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
Similar to how time slot is stored in `Module` class, the clashing slots in `ClashCase` are represented as Integers and
each integer value corresponds to a particular 1-hour time slot in a week.

Each `ClashCommand` has a `execute()` method that takes in a `Model` object and a `FilterOnlyCommandHistory` object.
`ClashCommand` only retrieves information from model and returns a message to be shown in the message bar but do not alter anything in the existing lists.

====
There are a few formats allowed for user inputs:

* `clash a/INDEX`: check timetable clash for a add/drop module appeal
* `clash m/INDEX m/INDEX` or `clash m/MODULE_CODE m/MODULE_CODE`: check timetable clash between two different modules
* `clash s/INDEX`: check timetable clash in a student's current timetable

====

Below shows how the Clash Command mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user inputs `clash ...` to check whether there is clash in the timetable.

Step 2. The `ClashCommandParser` will be called to create a new `ClashCommandParameters` and set the relevant parameter values accordingly.

Step 3. A new `ClashCommand` is created by passing in the `ClashCommandParameters` object.
The following sequence diagram shows how `ClashCommandParser` works:

Step 4. `ClashCommand.execute()` is called. The types of checking will be determined by checking the presence of relevant parameters in `ClashCommandParameters`.

[NOTE]
** The `Student` who submits the appeal is stored as String of Matric ID and `Module` to add/drop is stored as String of module code in an `Appeal` object.
Hence, `Student` who submits the appeal is retrieved from `model.getFullStudentList()` by matching Matric ID,
and `Module` to add/drop is retrieved from `model.getFullModuleList()` by matching module codes.

Step 5. Each `ClashCommand` returns a `CommandResult` object which contains the message of the clash details if there are clashes and 'No clashes detected' if there is no clash.

The following activity diagram shows how the clash command works:

.Work Flow of Clash Command
image::ClashCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

===== Design Consideration: How to deal with different user input formats for different types of checking

* **Current choice:** Only 1 `ClashCommand` class. Every `ClashCommand` object keeps a `ClashCommandParameters` object which stores the parameters passed in.
The value of parameters are set when parsing user inputs by a few setter methods.
The cases of checking are determined in `ClashCommand.execute()` by checking the presence of each parameter.
** Pros:
*** Avoid having too many unnecessary constructors (or passing of null-values) caused by the optional nature of the parameters passed to ClashCommand.
*** If more user input formats are allowed in the future to improve user experience (not restricted to index and module codes),
we can simply add more setter and getter methods in `ClashCommandParameters` accordingly.
** Cons:
*** More defensive programming is needed to ensure that no multiple parameters of different types of checking are present at the same time.
* **Alternative considered:** Create three different sub-classes (i.e. `ClashAppealCommand`, `ClashModuleCommand`, and `ClashStudentCommand`) which extend an abstract `ClashCommand` class.
`ClashCommandParser` deals with differentiating cases for checking (by looking at prefixes) and create Command object accordingly.
** Pros:
*** Each `ClashCommand` has knowledge about what type of checking is evoked. Less checking is required in `ClashCommand.execute()`.
** Cons:
*** Each sub-class will have different attributes.
*** Tedious modification will be needed if we allow more user input formats in the future to improve user experience.

===== Design Consideration: How to show details of the clashing time slots

* **Current choice:** Use a static class `ClashCase` to store each clash case detected.
** Pros:
*** No need to hardcode the string representation of clash details since all information needed is stored in the `ClashCase` and we can simply call `toString()`.
Even if the way of representation is to be changed in the future, we only need to modify `toString()` (and add attributes in `ClashCase` if needed).
** Cons:
*** Additional objects being created for each clash detected between two modules. More memory space used.
* **Alternative considered:** Every `ClashCommand` object keeps a list of to store time slot index and use them to create a temporary `Module` object.
** Pros:
*** Easy to implement.
*** Can reuse `getTimeSlotToString()` to obtain the string representation. (The current choice also keeps this part)
** Cons:
*** Redundant objects are created. More memory space used.
*** Need to hardcode information like module codes of the two modules having clashes since the list only stores the clashing slots.
*** Tedious modification needed if the way of response changes in the future. For example, instead of showing the clash details in the message bar,
we decide to a pop-up window to show more detailed information or include graphic representation.
// end::clash[]

//tag::addremovemod[]
=== Add and remove module feature
==== Implementation
The addmod/removemod mechanism is facilitated by an abstract `ModCommand` class which extends abstract `Command` class.
There are the two sub-classes which extends `ModCommand` used to handle adding module or removing module function.

The two sub-classes are:

* `AddModCommand` -- Add a module to a student (Registers the student for a particular module)
* `RemoveModCommand` -- Removes a module from a student (Drops a module from the student's workload)

image::ModCommandClassDiagram.png[]

Each addmod or removemod command has a `execute()` method that takes in a `Model` object. These commands
retrieve information of all students and modules from model to get the relevant student and module.
It then creates a copy of the relevant items and replaces the original ones in the global list of students and modules.

Below shows how the AddModCommand mechanism behaves at each step when adding a module to a student.

[NOTE]
RemoveMod command is functionally the opposite of AddMod command, but requires less checks to be done before successful
execution. For this developer guide, only AddMod commands sequence will be elaborated.

Step 1. The user inputs `addmod s/A0180000 m/CS1010` to add module CS1010 to student A0180000.

Step 2. The `ApproveCommandParser` will be called to parse the AddModCommand.

* When parsing the input, the `s/` prefix will be detected and `AddModCommandParser` will parse for a
student identifier. `m/` prefix will also be detected and parsed for a module identifier.

Step 3. `AddModCommand` object will be created.

Step 4. `AddModCommand.execute()` is called.

The following activity diagram shows how `AddModCommand.execute()` works

image::AddModCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

`ApproveCommand.execute()`

* Step 1. Checks for the validity of student and module identifiers. If index is given as the identifier, the following
list(s) is used: `model.getFilteredModuleList` and `model.getFilteredStudentList`. If Matric Id is given for student identifier
or Module code is given for module identifier, it will get the following list(s) instead:
`model.getFullModuleList` and `model.getFullStudentList`
* Step 2. Checks the following conditions that should prevent module from being added to student:
** Check if the student already has the module (Is currently registered for module already)
** Check if the student has completed the module before
** Check if the module current intake has already reached quota limit, and is unable to accept any more students
** Check if the student workload limit will not be exceeded if the module is added to the student
** Check if the module being added will clash with any existing modules the student is currently taking.
* Step 3. Creates a new student object and module object with the added module.
* Step 4. Creates a `CommandResult` object which calls `Model` to replace the old objects
with the newly created objects. The success message of addmod request will be returned.

The following sequence diagram shows how ApproveCommand works:

image::AddModSequenceDiagram.png[]
[NOTE]
An exception is thrown when any of the checks fail. The break interaction operator is placed at the bottom
of all the checks in order to reduce vision clutter.
[NOTE]
To reduce vision clutter, only two of the six checks are shown.
//end::addremovemod[]

//tag::resolve[]
=== Resolve feature
==== Implementation

The resolve feature is facilitated by an abstract `ResolveCommand` class which extends abstract `Command` class and
2 sub-classes which extends `ResolveCommand` for different types of appeal resolution.

The 2 type of appeal resolution are:

* `Approve` -- approves an appeal.
* `Reject` -- rejects an appeal.

Each appeal resolution type has an individual and mass resolution command which extends its base type

The 2 types of resolution commands for `Approve` are

* `ApproveCommand` -- approves an individual appeal by index shown in the in-app UI
* `MassApprove` -- approves multiple appeals by the ID of appeals

Similarly the types of resolution commands for `Reject` are

* `RejectCommand` -- rejects an individual appeal by index shown in the in-app UI
* `MassReject` -- rejects multiple appeals by the ID of appeals

image::ResolveCommandClassDiagram.png[]

Each appeal resolution command has a `execute()` method that takes in a `Model` object. Resolve commands retrieve information of all students and modules from model to get the relevant student and module.
It then creates a copy of the relevant items and replaces the original ones in the global list of students and modules

Below shows how the ResolveCommand mechanism behaves at each step when resolving a single appeal.

[NOTE]
Reject commands behaves the same way as approve commands, except it will not make any changes to any students or module. For this developer guide, only approve commands sequence will be elaborated

Step 1. The user inputs `approve a/2 r/Student meets requirements` to approve an appeal of index specified.  In this example the appeal index is 2.

Step 2. The `ApproveCommandParser` will be called to parse the individual approve command .

* When parsing the input, the `a/` prefix will be detected and `ApproveCommandParser` will parse a single index and the remark after the optional field `r/`.

Step 3. `ApproveCommand` object will be created.

Step 4. `ApproveCommand.execute()` is called.

`ApproveCommand.execute()`

* Step 1. It will check the type of appeal of the appeal index specified by the user, it will check through `model.getFilteredAppealList()` and get the index of the appeal that matches that of the given one.
* Step 2. Checks whether the appeal has already been resolved with `Appeal.isResolved()`
* Step 3. If is not yet resolved, nature of appeal will be retrieved with `Appeal.getAppealType()`.  There are 3 types of appeal cases - add module, drop module and increase workload
** Add module
***  Check if relevant module and student exists by getting `model.getFullModuleList()` and `model.getFullStudentList()`
***  Check for clashes between module requested and the modules the student is current taking (refer to 3.1 for implementation for `ClashCommand`)
***  If no clashes are detected add student to module class list and module to the student's list of modules
** Drop module
***  Check if relevant module and student exists by getting `model.getFullModuleList()` and `model.getFullStudentList()`
***  Check if student is taking the module
***  Removes specified module from student and student from module
** Increase workload
***  Increases the specified student's workload to the one specified in the appeal

The following activity diagram shows how `ApproveCommand.execute()` works

image::ApproveCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
The student current modules are stored as String of module code to reduce coupling. Hence, modules taken by the student are retrieved from `model.getFilteredModuleList()` by matching module codes.


[NOTE]
The `Student` who submits the appeal and requested `Module` are stored as String of Matric ID and module code respectively in an `Appeal` object to reduce coupling.
Hence, `Student` who submits the appeal is retrieved from `model.getFilteredStudentList()` by matching Matric ID,
and `Module` requested is retrieved from `model.getFilteredModuleList()` by matching module codes.


Step 5.  Upon approval of an appeal, `ApproveCommand` will return a `CommandResult` object which contains the message of the action performed.  Each appeal type will give a different feedback message.

 * Add module will inform user if approval is not allowed due to clashes in time table, else it will feedback the specified module has been added to the student by their IDs

 * Drop module will inform user if approval is not allowed due to the student not having the module to be dropped in the first place, else if will feedback the specified module was removed from the student by their IDs

 * Increase workload will inform user of the increase inthe student's Modular Credits limit

The following sequence diagram shows how ApproveCommand works:

image::ResolveSequenceDiagram.png[]


Below shows how the ResolveCommand mechanism behaves at each step when resolving multiple appeals.

Step 1. The user inputs `approve mass/C000000 C000001 C000010` to approve all the appeals specifed.

Step 2. The `ApproveCommandParser` will be called to parse the mass approve command.

* When parsing the input, the `mass/` prefix will be detected and `ApproveCommandParser` will parse all the appeal IDs specifed.  Valid and invalid IDs will be separated into 2 lists.

Step 3. `MassApprove` object will be created with both the lists of valid and invalid IDs.

Step 4. `MassApprove.execute()` is called.

`MassApprove.execute()`

[NOTE]
Mass resolve commands `execute()` methods works the same as individual Resolve commands except it will loop through the list of valid Appeal IDs to resolve each one.
Successful resolution of each appeal in the valid appeal list will add the ID to successful list.
Similarly, appeal IDs from valid Appeal IDs that were not approved/rejected will be added to the unsuccessful list.
Also, because Mass resolve commands operates on appeal IDs, `model.getFullAppealList()` will be used instead of `model.getFilteredAppealList()`.


* Step 1. It will check the type of appeal of the appeal index specified by the user, it will check through `model.getFullAppealList()` and get the index of the appeal that matches that of the given one.
* Step 2. Checks weather the appeal has already been resolved with `Appeal.isResolved()`
* Step 3. If is not yet resolved, nature of appeal will be retrieved with `Appeal.getAppealType()`.  There are 3 types of appeal cases - add module, drop module and increase workload
** Add module
***  Check if relevant module and the student exists by getting `model.getFullModuleList()` and `model.getFullStudentList()`
***  Check for clashes between module requested and the modules the student is current taking (refer to 3.1 for implementation for `ClashCommand`)
***  If no clashes are detected add the student to module class list and module to the student's list of modules
** Drop module
***  Check if relevant module and student exists by getting `model.getFullModuleList()` and `model.getFullStudentList()`
***  Check if student is taking the module
***  Removes specified module from student and student from module
** Increase workload
***  Increases the specified student's workload to the one specified in the appeal

The following activity diagram shows how `MassApprove.execute()` works

image::MassApproveActivityDiagram.png[]

Step 5.  After resolving all the appeal IDs in the valid Appeal list, `MassApprove` will return a `CommandResult` object which contains the feedback message.  Feedback message will show a list of successfully approved appeal IDs,
a list of unresolved modules which include the list of invalid appeal IDs entered by user and appeal IDs
and a list of appeal IDs with time table clash detected.


image::MassResolveSequenceDiagram.png[]

Design Consideration: How to handle different user input formats for individual and mass appeal resolution

* Current choice: Resolving individual appeals, `ApproveCommand` and `RejectCommand` takes in a single index relative to the displayed list of appeals while resolving multiple appeals, `MassApprove` and `MassReject` takes in IDs of exisiting appeals.

** Pros:
*** User can easily resolve a single appeal since needs to enter the index of the appeal of choice shown in the appeal list.
*** When resolving in bulk, typing the full appeal IDs will allow user to be certain that the appeal that is about to be resolved is indeed the correct one.
** Cons:
*** Users have to type the full appeal IDs of appeals when resolving in bulk.
*** Users cannot resolve multiple appeals by index as the displayed appeal list is may be changing constantly with the filter commands entered by user.  As a result, user will be more prone to resolving a wrong appeal due to carelessness when using index.

* Alternative consideration: Allow user to resolve individual and multiple appeals by both index and appeal ID.

** Pros:
*** User has options to perform appeal resolution.
*** Easier to resolve multiple appeals in bulk, as it is quicker to type the index instead of the full ID
** Cons:
*** Harder to implement.  `ApproveCommandParser` and `RejectCommandParser` will need to parse different type of parameters.
*** Some index and parameters from  the input might refer to the same appeal if the user makes a mistake.  As such, feedback provided by MAMS will not be useful, as user might have used index to mass resolve rather than appeal ID.
*** User could resolve the wrong appeals since user does not need to cross check with the appeal ID of the appeals-of-interest.

Design Consideration: How individual resolve and mass resolve extends from parent `ResolveCommand`

* Current implementation: Each resolve option `Approve` and `Reject` extends from `ResolveCommand`

** Pros:
*** Easier to implement.  Resolve option specified by user will be easily parsed.
** Cons:
*** More parameters required from user to specify whether to resolve single or multiple appeals.


* Alternative consideration: Having individual resolve commands and mass resolve commands extend from parent class `ResolveCommand` instead of `Approve` and `Reject`.  Refer to diagram below for better understanding.

image::ResolveAltClassDiagram.png[]

** Pros:
*** User can specify whether to resolve single or multiple appeals with fewer keywords.
** Cons:
*** Harder to implement as the mass resolve command Parser will have to parse the inputs for different resolve types.
*** User prone to input mistakes while performing mass resolve.

//end::resolve[]

// tag::history[]
=== Command History
The command history feature encapsulates a few different related functions, mainly:

* The ability to cycle through previous inputs in the `CommandBox` using the kbd:[&uarr;]
and kbd:[&darr;] arrow keys.
* A command to open a new window displaying the command history
- Optional parameters can be specified to hide command output
* Persistent storage of command history - the history is serialized to JSON file format
and is loaded upon the next startup

==== Cycling Through Previous Inputs
The core of the cycle-command-history feature is implemented through three different classes:
 `CommandHistory`, `ListPointer`, and `InputOutput`. In addition, the `CommandBox` was modified
to accomodate the UX changes.

* `InputOutput`: Class wrapper around two `String` objects representing the command input
and command feedback output from MAMS. It is chiefly comprised of an input and an output, hence
the name.
* `CommandHistory`: A wrapper around a list of `InputOutput` objects along with specific methods, representing
the command history of the command entered thus far.
* `ListPointer`: An iterable pointer to a `List` of objects.
- This differs from `java.util.Iterator` in the sense that `ListPointer#next()` always advances the pointer first then returns the
next element in the `List`, while `java.util.Iterator#next()` does the opposite: it returns
the current value, then advances the pointer.
- `ListPointer` was implemented using Java generics
to serve as a common utility class in `mams.common.util`, but is used primarily for
iterating a `List` of `InputOutput` objects for the command history feature.
* `CommandBox`: The command box in MAMs was modified to respond to the kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;]
arrows, constantly replacing the text field with the previous commands when iterating.

Below is a class diagram depicting the relationship between the involved classes for cycling
through previous inputs in the command box.

image::CycleCommandHistoryClassDiagram.png[]

`CommandHistory` provides an unmodifiable view into the command history using an `ObservableList`
passed to `CommandBox` upon initialization. `CommandBox` uses this list to reinitialize and
update `ListPointer` after every command execution. Upon initialization, `ListPointer` keeps
an internal copy of the InputOutput list. Finally, `CommandBox` responds to key-presses and
retrieves the previous commands by using `ListPointer` to iterate
through its internal defensive list.

Below is a simple sequence diagram depicting this function. Note that some methods/pathways are not
depicted for brevity.

image::CycleCommandHistorySequenceDiagram.png[]

The diagram above first shows how `CommandBox` re-initializes and updates `ListPointer` after
a command has been entered. Thereafter (in the period between command inputs),
`KeyEvent` events are handled by `handleKeyPress`,
which replaces the text in its text field accordingly.

To be continued...

placement of commandHistory attribute
alternatives: usage of ListPointer versus Iterator

==== Displaying History Window: `HistoryCommand`

The `HistoryCommand` feature allows users to display a separate window showing the
MAMS input/output history upon command.

The core of the `HistoryCommand` feature is facilitated by a few different classes:

* `HistoryCommand`: A sub-type of `Command`. Represents a user command to trigger the display
of the history window.
* `HistoryCommandParser`: A class to parse user input in the context of a `HistoryCommand`,
returning a `HistoryCommand`.
* `HistoryWindow`: A UI class representing the controller for the history window. Displays information
about the command history to the user
* `CommandHistory`: see previous section.

The following activity sequence diagram provides a high-level view
of how the command is executed:

image::HistoryCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

One specific execution example of the show-history feature with
more specific implementation details is as follows:

1. User enters `history -h` into command box.
2. A `HistoryCommand` object is created after parsing, with `hideOutput` set to true.
3. `HistoryCommand` is executed and produces a `CommandResult`
with `showHistory` and `hideOutput` flags set to true.
4. `CommandResult` is passed to the calling GUI element (`MainWindow`), which is then used to set
the flags in `HistoryWindow` contoller accordingly.
5. `HistoryWindow` hides all command outputs in the history window.
6. `MainWindow` gets `CommandHistory` from `Logic`, and uses it to update `HistoryWindow`.
7. GUI displays the history window.

This specific execution case is shown in the following sequence diagram. Note that some
methods are omitted for brevity.

image::HistoryCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `HistoryCommandParser` and `HistoryCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X), but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.


*Design Considerations*


* Current Implementation: `HistoryCommand` sets boolean flags (`showHistory` and `hideOutput`)
in `CommandResult` to prompt the GUI to display the history window and hide command outputs
respectively.

** Pros:
*** `CommandHistory` does not need to be passed in as a parameter for
`Command#execute`. There is thus no need to
modify the existing `Command` abstract class, which will require
changes to every single existing `Command` sub-type (for very little benefit,
since `HistoryCommand` is the only existing `Command` that acts on `CommandHistory`).
*** `HistoryCommand` does not need to handle the formatting and display of
`CommandHistory` in the history GUI window. This separates their responsibilities
better as such display options should be left up to the GUI classes.
*** Since `HistoryCommand` only sets parameter flags for the `HistoryWindow`, and
the `HistoryWindow` controller gets the history data directly from an `ObservableList`, the
history window GUI is able to update while adhering to the user-specified configuration
(ie. hide output/ show output) after every command iteration, even if `HistoryCommand` is not executed.

** Cons:
*** If more parameters need to be added to `HistoryCommand` (eg. filter history
display by execution success) in future iterations of MAMS, more boolean flags
will have to be added to the `CommandResult` class. This can eventually be
unsustainable if there are too many parameters that needs to be communicated
to the GUI.

* Alternative Implementation 1: Change the method signature in `Command#execute(Model model)`
to accept a `CommandHistory` object. `HistoryCommand` will format the command history
text based on the user specifications, then pass the formatted text as a single string in the
`feedbackToUser` parameter. The `HistoyWindow` controller will then display this text on
on the history window.

** Pros:
*** Since all of the user specifications and flags are processed within execution of
`HistoryCommand`, `CommandResult` does not need to store too many flags if future
parameters are added to `HistoryCommand`. (Refer to the current implementation)

**  Cons:
*** Requires a change to `execute()` method signature of the `Command` abstract class. Since all
other commands are a sub-type of the `Command` class, this will require a change to every other
command, which will necessitate huge changes across many classes and tests, and may result
in regression problems,.
*** Text display formatting is handled directly by the `HistoryCommand` class, which limits
the ability of the GUI to customize the display. Moreover, the `HistoryCommand` class is now
in charge of one aspect of the display formatting, which is not a good separation of responsibilities
between the `Logic` and `Ui` components of MAMS.
*** If the entire command history is passed to `Logic` as a `CommandResult` feedback of
an executed `HistoryCommand`, future requests of the command history will also include
that that particular `HistoryCommand` feedback.
**** A crude CLI example of this is shown below.

 >> history
 input: list -a
 output: listed all appeals
 >> history
 input: list -a
 output: listed all appeals
 input: history
 output: input: list -a
         output: listed all appeals
 >> history
 input: list -a
 output: listed all appeals
 input: history
 output: input: list -a
         output: listed all appeals
 input: history
 output: input: list -a
         output: listed all appeals
         input: history
         output: input: list -a
                 output: listed all appeals

**** Special conditionals hence needs to be implemented to handle
such cases when updating `CommandHistory`, which can make the implementation
more complicated.

=== UI/UX

The GUI interface from AddressBook-Level3 was re-designed to incorporate additional
elements and features for MAMS. These include:

* Two additional types of List Panels, up to a total of 3. (`AppealListPanel`,
`ModuleListPanel`, `StudentListPanel`)
* Two additional types of List Cards, up to a total of 3. (`AppealCard`, `ModuleCard`,
`StudentCard`)
* Three additional types of Expanded Cards, up to a total of 3. The purpose of these
is to serve as a full display of information contained in each item type, as opposed to
the brief summary shown on the normal List Cards. (`ExpandedAppealCard`, `ExpandedModuleCard`,
`ExpandedStudentCard`) [Ongoing]
* CSS Theme redesign for a more vibrant dark mode interface
* Simple unix-style command history (up and down arrows to cycle
through previously entered commands)

The existing elements adapted from AddressBook are:

* Command Box
* Result Box

Although it may at first seem natural to define a common ListPanel parent for all three types of ListPanels due
to the similar semantics behind them, they share almost no fields or method signatures in common. The same goes for
Cards and Expanded Cards.

==== List Panel (`AppealListPanel`, `ModuleListPanel`, `StudentListPanel`)

Each type of List Panel is built to contain their respective cards (eg. `AppealListPanel` can contain a list of
`AppealCard` or a `ExpandedAppealCard`). The fields shown on each card is specific to the type, but are similar in nature.
As an example, the `ModuleCard` contains the following GUI elements:

* `ModuleCard#moduleCode` - `Label` element displaying module code
* `ModuleCard#moduleName` - `Label` element displaying the module name
* `ModuleCard#id` - `Label` element displaying the card's index within the displayed list
* `ModuleCard#lecturerName` - `Label` element displaying the name of the module coordinator
* `ModuleCard#timeSlot` - `Label` element displaying the weekly lecture slots for the module
* `ModuleCard#enrolment` - `Label` element displaying student enrolment in text form
* `ModuleCard#quota` - `Label` element displaying total module capacity in text form
* `ModuleCard#quotaBar` - `ProgressBar` element displaying the filled student capacity (enrolment & total capacity) of the module in a
visual bar representation.
* Miscellaneous `Label` elements as descriptors of some elements above (eg. `Coordinator:`)

In addition, the `ModuleListPanel` may also hold an `ExpandedModuleCard`. Although an Expanded Card contains all the fields
present in their corresponding Card, they are formatted differently to take advantage of the additional height, and also have additional
fields present. As an example, the `ExpandedModuleCard` contains the following fields in addition to the ones above:

* `ExpandedModuleCard#description` - `Text` element displaying the full description of the module
* `ExpandedModuleCard#students` - `Text` element displaying the full list of students in the module

When the GUI detects only one item in the List Panel to be displayed, it automatically defaults to using the Expanded Card
for displaying the item, eg., performing a `find` command that returns only one module as the result will cause the GUI to display
the single module using `ExpandedModuleCard`.

//tag::undo[]
=== Backup and undo actions feature
==== Implementation

The backup feature is facilitated by an abstract `StoreCommand` class which extends abstract `Command` class and
three sub-classes which extends `StoreCommand` to handle different types of saving and restoring actions.

The three sub-classes are:

* `SaveCommand` -- Creates a snapshot of MAMS as a backup and stores it as a json file in data.
* `UndoCommand` -- Undo last action.
* `RedoCommand` -- Redo last undo.

image::StoreCommandClassDiagram.png[]

Each sub-class has a `execute()` method that takes in a `Model` object. Store commands only retrieve information from /data file and replaces the current state with the targeted state.

Below shows how the Store Command mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user inputs `undo/redo/backup ...`.

Step 2. The relevant parser class is called.

Step 3. Relevant StoreCommand object will be created accordingly depending on steps required to store or restore states.

Step 4. `StoreCommand.execute()` is called.

* If the command is a `UndoCommand`, it will store a snapshot in the data file under its corresponding tag.
* If the command is a `RedoCommand`, it will check if a redo action is availiable, restores the state and update the saved states as required.
* If the command is a `SaveCommand`, it will store a snapshot in the data file under its given tag or a tagged with a timestamp to avoid overwriting previous data if tag is not given.

[NOTE]
The save states are stored in the same format as the mams.json data file to reduce coupling of the saving mechanism and the save commands.

Step 5. Each `StoreCommand` returns a `CommandResult` object which contains the success or failure of the action and the filename the backup is saved under if applicable.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

===== Aspect: Dealing with storage of states

* **Current Choice:** Saves state to data folder in the same file format as the main data.
** Pros: Persistence of previous actions independent of running state of the program, allows for crash recovery in the event the program is exited incorrectly.
** Cons: Opens the program up to attacks that target the data folder, as the states are now accessable outside of the program instead of protected by a layer of abstraction.
* **Alternative :** Saves states as internal list of states
** Pros: States are only accessable using the application, protecting it from unwanted modifications.
** Cons: States are limited to current instance of the application, and history cannot be transfered between sessions

===== Aspect: Replacing the current state with targeted undo/redo states

* **Current choice:** Reads lists stored in targeted data file and replaces current data with targeted data
** Pros: Does not require knowledge of implementation of running state, thus reducing coupling of StoreCommand and program state.
** Cons: Requires StoreCommand to be modified each time a new type of list is implemented.
* **Alternative :** Replace the whole model with a new instance of target model
** Pros: Decreases coupling between internal implementation of any lists and StoreCommand
** Cons: Increases coupling between the Logic class and Command subclasses

=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:

A specialized Appeal Administrator that handles module appeals during
the hectic start-of-semester module registration in the National
University of Singapore. He/She:

* prefers desktop apps over other types
* prefers typing over mouse input
* can type fast
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps
* has a need to view large lists of modules, appeal cases, and student
particulars
* has a need to edit current student/appeal/module information to
resolve appeal cases
* has *neither the authority nor need* to add/remove students, appeals,
and modules to/from the current database (out of job purview)
* needs to keep a permanent log of all actions taken when resolving appeals.

*Value proposition*: View, manage, and resolve appeals as fast as or
faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app.
