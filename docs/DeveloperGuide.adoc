== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `mams.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

//tag::clash[]
=== Clash feature
==== Implementation

The clash feature is facilitated by an abstract `ClashCommand` class which extends abstract `Command` class and
three sub-classes which extends `ClashCommand` to handle different types of checking.

The three sub-classes are:

* `ClashModCommand` -- check time slots clashes within two modules and return messages accordingly.
* `ClashStudentCommand` -- check time slots clashes within a particular student's timetable and return messages accordingly.
* `ClashAppealCommand` -- check time slots clashes between the requested module and the student's existing timetable for a "Add Module" appeal .

image::ClashCommandClassDiagram.png[]

Each sub-class has a `execute()` method that takes in a `Model` object. Clash commands only retrieve information from model but do not alter anything in the existing lists.

Below shows how the Clash Command mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user inputs `clash ...` to check whether there is clash in the timetable.

Step 2. The `ClashCommandParser` will be called first to check which of the three types of checking is evoked by checking the prefixes.

Step 3. Relevant `ClashModCommand`, `ClashStudentCommand`, or `ClashAppealCommand` object will be created accordingly.

Step 4. `ClashCommand.execute()` is called.

* If the command is a `ClashModCommand`, it will get the relevant `Module` objects from the list `model.getFilteredModuleList()`.
* If the command is a `ClashStudentCommand`, it will get the relevant `Student` object from the list `model.getFilteredStudentList()`.

[NOTE]
The student current modules are stored as String of module code to reduce coupling. Hence, modules taken by the student are retrieved from `model.getFilteredModuleList()` by matching module codes.

* If the command is a `ClashAppealCommand`, it will get the relevant `Appeal` object from the list `model.getFilteredAppealList()`

[NOTE]
The `Student` who submits the appeal and requested `Module` are stored as String of Matric ID and module code respectively in an `Appeal` object to reduce coupling.
Hence, `Student` who submits the appeal is retrieved from `model.getFilteredStudentList()` by matching Matric ID,
and `Module` requested is retrieved from `model.getFilteredModuleList()` by matching module codes.

Step 5. Each `ClashCommand` returns a `CommandResult` object which contains the message of the clashing time slots if there are clashes and 'No clashes detected' if there is no clash.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::ClashSequenceDiagram.png[]

===== Aspect: How to deal with different user inputs for different checking

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create three different sub-classes extending `ClashCommand` class. `ClashCommand` will deal with differentiating cases for checking and create Command object accordingly.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: some of the code are different to be abstracted. (repeted codes in part of the two sub-classes to keep low coupling) May need to find a way to improve it in the future.
* **Alternative 2:** Only 1 `ClashCommand` class. The cases of checking are determined inside `ClashCommand`.
** Pros:
** Cons: Violates Single Responsibility Principle. `ClashCommand` is doing part of the parsing work.

===== Aspect: String representation of clashig time slots

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store time slot index and use them to create a temporary `Module` object.
** Pros: Can reuse `getTimeSlotToString()` to obtain the string representation
** Cons: Redundant objects are created. More memory space used.
// end::clash[]

//tag::find[]
=== Find feature
==== Implementation

The find feature is facilitated by `FindCommand` class. The `FindCommand` constructor takes a `List` of `Predicates`, which can be `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `ModuleContainsKeywordsPredicate`, or `AppealContainsKeywordsPredicate`

image::PredicateClassDiagram.png[]

Find commands only retrieve information from model but do not alter anything in the existing lists.

Below shows how the Find Command mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user inputs `find prefix/[KEYWORDS]...`.

Step 2. The `FindCommandParser` will be called first to check which of the three lists to search by checking the prefixes.
`NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `ModuleContainsKeywordsPredicate`, and `AppealContainsKeywordsPredicate` will be created accordingly which stores all the keywords for the same list.

Step 3. A new `FindCommand` is created.

[NOTE]
Even there is no keyword for a particular `Predicate`, a new `Predicate` object with an empty `List` of keywords will be passed in to create a new `FindCommand`.
Eg. input: `find s/bob`. A new `FindCommand` is created with a `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` with a `List` of keywords containing `bob`, and `ModuleContainsKeywordsPredicate`, and `AppealContainsKeywordsPredicate` with empty `List` of keywords.

Step 4. `FindCommand.execute()` is called. Each `Predicate` object is examined and calls `Predicate.test()`. `Model#updateStudentList()`, `Model#updateModuleList()`, or `Module#updateAppealList()` is called accordingly.

Step 5. A `CommandResult` object is returned, which contains message about the number of items found in the target list. The target list only shows the item contains keyword.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::FindSequenceDiagram.png[]
// end::find[]


// tag::history[]
=== Command History
The command history feature encapsulates a few different related functions, mainly:

* The ability to cycle through previous inputs in the `CommandBox` using the kbd:[&uarr;]
and kbd:[&darr;] arrow keys.
* A command to open a new window displaying the command history
- Optional parameters can be specified to hide command output
* Persistent storage of command history - the history is serialized to JSON file format
and is loaded upon the next startup

==== Cycling Through Previous Inputs
The core of the cycle-command-history feature is implemented through three different classes:
 `CommandHistory`, `ListPointer`, and `InputOutput`.

* `InputOutput`: Class wrapper around two `String` objects representing the command input
and command feedback output from MAMS. It is chiefly comprised of an input and an output, hence
the name.
* `CommandHistory`: A wrapper around a list of `InputOutput` objects along with specific methods, representing
the command history of the command entered thus far.
* `ListPointer`: An iterable pointer to a `List` of objects.
- This differs from `java.util.Iterator` in the sense that `ListPointer#next()` always advances the pointer first then returns the
next element in the `List`, while `java.util.Iterator#next()` does the opposite: it returns
the current value, then advances the pointer.
- `ListPointer` was implemented using Java generics
to serve as a common utility class in `mams.common.util`, but is used primarily for
iterating a `List` of `InputOutput` objects for the command history feature.
* `CommandBox`: The command box in MAMs was modified to respond to the kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;]
arrows, constantly replacing the text field with the previous commands when iterating.

Below is a class diagram depicting the relationship between the involved classes for cycling
through previous inputs in the command box.

image::CycleCommandHistoryClassDiagram.png[]

`CommandHistory` provides an unmodifiable view into the command history using an `ObservableList`
passed to `CommandBox` upon initialization. `CommandBox` uses this list to reinitialize and
update `ListPointer` after every command execution. Upon initialization, `ListPointer` keeps
an internal copy of the InputOutput list. Finally, `CommandBox` responds to key-presses and
retrieves the previous commands by using `ListPointer` to iterate
through its internal defensive list.

Below is a simple sequence diagram depicting this function. Note that some methods/pathways are not
depicted for brevity.

image::CycleCommandHistorySequenceDiagram.png[]

The diagram above first shows how `CommandBox` re-initializes and updates `ListPointer` after
a command has been entered. Thereafter (in the period between command inputs),
`KeyEvent` events are handled by `handleKeyPress`,
which replaces the text in its text field accordingly.

To be continued...

alternatives: usage of ListPointer versus Iterator

==== Displaying History Window: `HistoryCommand`

The `HistoryCommand` feature allows users to display a separate window showing the
MAMS input/output history upon command.

The core of the `HistoryCommand` feature is facilitated by a few different classes:

* `HistoryCommand`: A sub-type of `Command`. Represents a user command to trigger the display
of the history window.
* `HistoryCommandParser`: A class to parse user input in the context of a `HistoryCommand`,
returning a `HistoryCommand`.
* `HistoryWindow`: A UI class representing the controller for the history window. Displays information
about the command history to the user
* `CommandHistory`: see previous section.

The following activity sequence diagram provides a high-level view
of how the command is executed:

image::HistoryCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

One specific execution example of the show-history feature with
more specific implementation details is as follows:

1. User enters `history -h` into command box.
2. A `HistoryCommand` object is created after parsing, with `hideOutput` set to true.
3. `HistoryCommand` is executed and produces a `CommandResult`
with `showHistory` and `hideOutput` flags set to true.
4. `CommandResult` is passed to the calling GUI element (`MainWindow`), which is then used to set
the flags in `HistoryWindow` contoller accordingly.
5. `HistoryWindow` hides all command outputs in the history window.
6. `MainWindow` gets `CommandHistory` from `Logic`, and uses it to update `HistoryWindow`.
7. GUI displays the history window.

This specific execution case is shown in the following sequence diagram. Note that some
methods are omitted for brevity.

image::HistoryCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `HistoryCommandParser` and `HistoryCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X), but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.


*Design Considerations*


* Current Implementation: `HistoryCommand` sets boolean flags (`showHistory` and `hideOutput`)
in `CommandResult` to prompt the GUI to display the history window and hide command outputs
respectively.

** Pros:
*** `CommandHistory` does not need to be passed in as a parameter for
`Command#execute`. There is thus no need to
modify the existing `Command` abstract class, which will require
changes to every single existing `Command` sub-type (for very little benefit,
since `HistoryCommand` is the only `Command` that acts on `CommandHistory`).
*** `HistoryCommand` does not need to handle the formatting and display of
`CommandHistory` in the history GUI window. This separates their responsibilities
better as such display options should be left up to the GUI classes.
*** Since `HistoryCommand` only sets parameter flags for the `HistoryWindow`, and
the `HistoryWindow` controller gets the history data directly from an `ObservableList`, the
history window GUI is able to update while adhering to the user-specified configuration
(ie. hide output/ show output) after every command iteration, even if `HistoryCommand` is not executed.

** Cons:
*** If more parameters need to be added to `HistoryCommand` (eg. filter history
display by execution success) in future iterations of MAMS, more boolean flags
will have to be added to the `CommandResult` class. This can eventually be
unsustainable if there are too many parameters that needs to be communicated
to the GUI.

* Alternative Implementation 1: Change the method signature in `Command#execute(Model model)`
to accept a `CommandHistory` object. `HistoryCommand` will format the command history
text based on the user specifications, then pass the formatted text as a single string in the
`feedbackToUser` parameter. The `HistoyWindow` controller will then display this text on
on the history window.

** Pros:
*** Since all of the user specifications and flags are processed within execution of
`HistoryCommand`, `CommandResult` does not need to store too many flags if future
parameters are added to `HistoryCommand`. (Refer to the current implementation)

**  Cons:
*** Requires a change to `execute()` method signature of the `Command` abstract class. Since all
other commands are a sub-type of the `Command` class, this will require a change to every other
command, which will necessitate huge changes across many classes and tests, and may result
in regression problems,.
*** Text display formatting is handled directly by the `HistoryCommand` class, which limits
the ability of the GUI to customize the display. Moreover, the `HistoryCommand` class is now
in charge of one aspect of the display formatting, which is not a good separation of responsibilities
between the `Logic` and `Ui` components of MAMS.
*** If the entire command history is passed to `Logic` as a `CommandResult` feedback of
an executed `HistoryCommand`, future requests of the command history will also include
that that particular `HistoryCommand` feedback.
**** A crude CLI example of this is shown below.

 >> history
 input: list -a
 output: listed all appeals
 >> history
 input: list -a
 output: listed all appeals
 input: history
 output: input: list -a
         output: listed all appeals
 >> history
 input: list -a
 output: listed all appeals
 input: history
 output: input: list -a
         output: listed all appeals
 input: history
 output: input: list -a
         output: listed all appeals
         input: history
         output: input: list -a
                 output: listed all appeals

**** Special conditionals hence needs to be implemented to handle
such cases when updating `CommandHistory`, which can make the implementation
more complicated.

// end::history[]

// tag::ui[]
=== UI/UX

The GUI interface from AddressBook-Level3 was re-designed to incorporate additional
elements and features for MAMS. These include:

* Two additional types of List Panels, up to a total of 3. (`AppealListPanel`,
`ModuleListPanel`, `StudentListPanel`)
* Two additional types of List Cards, up to a total of 3. (`AppealCard`, `ModuleCard`,
`StudentCard`)
* Three additional types of Expanded Cards, up to a total of 3. The purpose of these
is to serve as a full display of information contained in each item type, as opposed to
the brief summary shown on the normal List Cards. (`ExpandedAppealCard`, `ExpandedModuleCard`,
`ExpandedStudentCard`) [Ongoing]
* CSS Theme redesign for a more vibrant dark mode interface
* Simple unix-style command history (up and down arrows to cycle
through previously entered commands)

The existing elements adapted from AddressBook are:

* Command Box
* Result Box

Although it may at first seem natural to define a common ListPanel parent for all three types of ListPanels due
to the similar semantics behind them, they share almost no fields or method signatures in common. The same goes for
Cards and Expanded Cards.

==== List Panel (`AppealListPanel`, `ModuleListPanel`, `StudentListPanel`)

Each type of List Panel is built to contain their respective cards (eg. `AppealListPanel` can contain a list of
`AppealCard` or a `ExpandedAppealCard`). The fields shown on each card is specific to the type, but are similar in nature.
As an example, the `ModuleCard` contains the following GUI elements:

* `ModuleCard#moduleCode` - `Label` element displaying module code
* `ModuleCard#moduleName` - `Label` element displaying the module name
* `ModuleCard#id` - `Label` element displaying the card's index within the displayed list
* `ModuleCard#lecturerName` - `Label` element displaying the name of the module coordinator
* `ModuleCard#timeSlot` - `Label` element displaying the weekly lecture slots for the module
* `ModuleCard#enrolment` - `Label` element displaying student enrolment in text form
* `ModuleCard#quota` - `Label` element displaying total module capacity in text form
* `ModuleCard#quotaBar` - `ProgressBar` element displaying the filled student capacity (enrolment & total capacity) of the module in a
visual bar representation.
* Miscellaneous `Label` elements as descriptors of some elements above (eg. `Coordinator:`)

In addition, the `ModuleListPanel` may also hold an `ExpandedModuleCard`. Although an Expanded Card contains all the fields
present in their corresponding Card, they are formatted differently to take advantage of the additional height, and also have additional
fields present. As an example, the `ExpandedModuleCard` contains the following fields in addition to the ones above:

* `ExpandedModuleCard#description` - `Text` element displaying the full description of the module
* `ExpandedModuleCard#students` - `Text` element displaying the full list of students in the module

When the GUI detects only one item in the List Panel to be displayed, it automatically defaults to using the Expanded Card
for displaying the item, eg., performing a `find` command that returns only one module as the result will cause the GUI to display
the single module using `ExpandedModuleCard`. In fact, it is the only case when an Expanded Card will be used.

This is because an Expanded Card is meant to take up the entire List Panel display when the user has decided to scrutinize a single item,
and it is hence not useful for other cells to be hidden out of view below the visible screen. This also neatly enforces the GUI-Logic
abstraction barrier by eliminating the need for MAMS Logic to control such GUI decisions.

// end::ui[]


// tag::undoredo[]
=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature

==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

[appendix]
== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:

A specialized Appeal Administrator that handles module appeals during
the hectic start-of-semester module registration in the National
University of Singapore. He/She:

* prefers desktop apps over other types
* prefers typing over mouse input
* can type fast
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps
* has a need to view large lists of modules, appeal cases, and student
particulars
* has a need to edit current student/appeal/module information to
resolve appeal cases
* has *neither the authority nor need* to add/remove students, appeals,
and modules to/from the current database (out of job purview)

*Value proposition*: View, manage, and resolve appeals as fast as or
faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app.

than using the mouse.
.  Should be quick and efficient, with each use case above taking less
than 5 minutes to navigate (excluding the time needed for user
consideration and decision)
.  Should be convenient for users to view details of different objects
at the same time.
.  Should be able to hold up to 40000 students and 1000 modules without
a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
.  Should only load data from current semesters by default.
