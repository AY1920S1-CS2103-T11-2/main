== Introduction

The Module Appeal Management System (MAMS) is a desktop app that aims to combine Command Line Interface (CLI) style commands with a dual-pane GUI for easy navigation of module appeals, module information, and student particulars. This app is particularly aimed towards *module appeal administrators who prefer to work through their heavy backload of module appeals without ever having to leave the comfort of the keyboard for their mouse*. The MAMS system can quickly bring up entire lists of students, appeals, and modules for side-by-side comparison, with specific display commands to view the expanded details of any particular object in question. Once reviewing of the information is complete, the MAMS system also provides a suite of commands for resolving appeals, overriding MC limits, and leaving special notes on students.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `MAMS.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for The Module Appeal Management System (MAMS).
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it.
.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Features

Broadly speaking, the MAMS handles three main types of items: *Students, Appeals, and Modules*. Each of these items may be further grouped into sub-lists.
eg. Students may be organized by matriculation year, course of study etc.

A student is uniquely identified by his/her 9-character Matriculation Number starting and ending with a letter, eg. `A0132243W`

An appeal request is uniquely identified by a prefix `C`, followed by a 6-digit Case ID, eg. `C123456`

A module is uniquely identified by a COURSE_PREFIX (eg. `CS` for Computer Science) and a 4 to 6 character sequence. eg. `CS2103` and `CS2103T`.

====
*Command Format*

* Each command must begin with a command word. See each command below for the list of associated command words.
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user eg. `DESCRIPTION_OF_TASK` denotes that you should provide a short description of the task.
* Items enclosed by square brackets are optional parameters that can be passed in eg. `view OBJECT_ID [l/]` can be used as `view A0122432Z l/` or `view 230293`.
* Any item that is followed by an ellipsis (`...`) can be used multiple times including zero eg. `[m/PARAMETER]...` can be used as, `m/CS2103` , `m/210` etc.
* Parameters within square brackets can be supplied in any order.
====

=== Viewing single objects: `view`

This command brings up an item with fully expanded details on a single pane. Multiple MAMS items can be displayed
in one single command, as long as they are from different types.

Format: `view [a/INDEX] [m/INDEX] [s/INDEX]`

Note: Even though all the parameter tags are marked as optional, at least one must be present for the command to
execute. In the case where a parameter tag is used more than once, the last tag of that type will be accepted.

Tags:

* `a/INDEX`: displays the expanded details of the appeal at `INDEX` on the displayed appeal list
* `m/INDEX`: displays the expanded details of the module at `INDEX` on the displayed module list
* `s/INDEX`: displays the expanded details of the student at `INDEX` on the displayed student list

*Examples:*

Sample Input:

* `view m/7`

image::ViewCommandDemoBefore.png[width="790"]

Sample Output: Fully expanded administrative details of the module at index 7.

image::ViewCommandDemoAfter.png[width="790"]

=== Listing objects by specified lists: `list`

Format: `list [-a] [-m] [-s]`

Tags:

* `-a`: lists out all appeals in MAMS
* `-m`: lists out all modules in MAMS
* `-s`: lists out all students in MAMS
* if no tags are specified, `list` command will behave as though all three tags have be applied. ie. it will
list out all appeals, modules, and students.

*Examples:*

Sample Input:

* `list -a -s`

image::ListCommandDemoBefore.png[width="790"]

Sample Output: Lists all appeals and students in MAMS

image::ListCommandDemoAfter.png[width="790"]

=== Command History

==== Cycle through command history

In the command box (the area where you type in commands), you can cycle through your previous inputs by using the
kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;] arrow keys. They will autofill the command box with the previous and next input stored
in the command history respectively.

Example:

image::HistoryCommandArrowDemoBefore.png[width="790"]

After pressing kbd:[&uarr;]

image::HistoryCommandArrowDemoAfter.png[width="790"]

==== Show command history: `history`

Opens a separate window displaying the command history in MAMS. The display of the command feedback can be turned
off.

TIP: Press the kbd:[esc] key to quickly exit the history window.

Format: `history [-h]`

Tags:

* `-h`: hide the command feedback in the history window
* if no tags are supplied, the `history` command will show both command input and command feedback history in the
history window.

*Examples:*

Sample Input:

* `history`

image::HistoryCommandDemo.png[width="790"]

Sample Output: Opens a window displaying command history

image::HistoryWindowDemo.png[width="790"]

==== Sync Command History to disk

Command history is automatically saved to disk whenever it is updated with new inputs.
Upon the next MAMS startup, previous command history will be loaded from disk as well.

=== Show clashes: `clash`

==== Show clashes between 2 modules
This command checks to see if the lecture slots of 2 modules clashes, and displays the result to the user

Format: `clash MODULE_CODE MODULE_CODE`

Examples:

* `clash cs1010 cs1020`

Sample output:

`Clash detected between CS1010 and CS1020: +
Time slot: 1400-1500 +
Event for CS1010: Lecture 1300-1500 +
Event for CS1020: Lecture 1400-1600`

* `clash ge1001 ge1002`

Sample output: `No clash detected for ge1001 and ge1002`


==== Show clashes in student timetable

Shows if there are clashes in a student’s (preallocated) timetable.
